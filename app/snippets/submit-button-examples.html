<!--
  Here is a simple submit button with an icon:
-->
<submit-button label="Sign Up" icon="fa fa-user"></submit-button>

<!--
  You can use your own <button> components within a formFor as well.
  If you choose to you must register your button with formFor's controller using registerSubmitButton().
  This method returns a model with a bindable 'disabled' attribute that your button should use like so:
-->
<form form-for="formData">
  <button ng-disabled="model.disabled">Submit</button>
</form>
